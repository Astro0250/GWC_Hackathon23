                One of the unique parts of Brooklyn Tech is the shear number 
                of students and clubs. This can be overwhelming but it is also 
                an opportunity to build a strong community of people with similar 
                interests. Our website, Vesta, helps students capitalize on this 
                opportunity by connecting them with friends and clubs in a central 
                hub. We provide a platform for students to find friends, join clubs, 
                and communicate with others, strengthening the Brooklyn Tech community.

                    User accounts - store user information about user interests, friends, and clubs. We implemented this using Firestore database, and simple client side code for users to make selections.
Friend Recommendations - we use common interests and interest category scores to calculate compatibility scores between users to recommend friends.
Clubs - users can add their clubs and other users can search and join those clubs. We implemented this by storing clubs and their member lists in the database.
Posts - users can make posts with their thoughts that are visible to anyone. Posts are stored on the database and show on the home page. They are linked to the poster using the user id.
DMs - users can communicate with their friends through DMs. This is implemented by storing and reading messages from our database.

                    The biggest obstacle was that none of us had ever done any backend development before. We have all only done web development in our web dev class, which only teaches the fundamentals of front end development. We had to learn how to set up hosting and our database and google authentication, which took a lot of time, adding stress to the project. We overcame these obstacles by reading a lot of documentation, and learning how to do simple tasks before combining those simple tasks to achieve more complex things.

                    One hard skill we learned is how to use Google Firebase to host a website and database. 

One soft skill we learned is how to manage our different skills so that everyone is working most productively. I am better at coding with JS while Christian Broomes is better at designing with CSS so we had to learn how to properly assign tasks to best leverage those skills.

                    We would like to add a calendar feature to help encourage in-person meetups. We would also like to add features to track club attendance, which can then be used to evaluate successful recommendations and improve the recommendation algorithm.
